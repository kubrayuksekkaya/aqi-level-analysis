# A COMPARATIVE AQI ANALYSIS: URBANIZATION, POPULATION AND MANUFACTURING

## Introduction

Air pollution is a growing concern for many countries and cities around the world. The negative impact of air pollution on human health and the environment has led to an urgent need to better understand the factors that contribute to air pollution levels. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the correlation and relationship between air pollution levels and certain factors such as manufacturing levels, population density, and urbanization in different countries and cities. Using statistical methods and machine learning techniques, the project will identify the main factors that contribute to air pollution levels and how they are correlated in different countries. With this understanding, the project aims to develop a model that predicts pollution levels based on the identified factors, which will be deployed and made available for use, and continuously monitored for performance and updated as needed. The ultimate goal of the project is to contribute to the development of effective policies and interventions to reduce air pollution levels and promote a healthier environment for everyone.

## Installation

To run the code for this project, the following libraries need to be installed:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
scikit-learn
These libraries can be installed via pip or conda, depending on your preference.

## Usage

The code for each section of the analysis can be found in their respective Jupyter Notebook files, which are located in the "notebooks" folder. Each notebook file includes code and comments that walk through the steps of the analysis.

To run the code, simply open the notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the cells in order.

## Data

The data used in this project can be found in the "data" folder. The data includes CSV files for population data, manufacturing data, and AQI data. These files have been preprocessed and cleaned for use in the analysis.

## Contributing
